# bukseryster
uhm.. well... server pulls notifications from supplied facebook RSS feed, client vibrates in your underpants once per notification. Social media masturbation done right.

Run the server in a screen session somewhere nice, like on an ubuntu server or something that isn't too firewalled, and has python on it.

Run it with the command ```./bukseryster.py "urlToFaceBookNotificationsRSSFeed"```

You can find your facebook notifications RSS feed url by googling how to find your facebook notifications RSS feed url

Run the client on an arduino connected to an Adafruit FONA board, (any SIM800 based board should do nicely)

Happy hacking
